726,SWE,"You have been asked to help design the ""CPSC 211 Student Transcript System"", whose purpose
is to display student transcripts. A transcript lists the courses a student took, sorted by session.
For each session, the transcript lists all courses taken by the student; both UBC courses for term
1 and term 2, and transfer courses (courses taken at another college or university, and whose
credit can be used towards a UBC degree). Finally, each object listed on a transcript may render
itself (i.e., may prepare to write itself out) if it is given a Renderer object. Each Renderer object
knows how to print tables, lines, string, etc… in a specific output format. For the moment we are
interested in HTML documents and Java GUI formats.
Suppose we have already determined that we likely need the following classes and interfaces for
this problem:
 Transcript - a student transcript
 Session – an academic session for the transcript ( i.e. 2007s, 2008w)
 Term – a term of an academic session ( term1, term2)
 Course – a university course that appears in a term of a session in the transcript
 UBCCourse – a course taken at UBC
 TransferCourse – a course taken outside UBC and transferred to UBC
 Renderer – the interface of a renderer that can render a transcript
 JavaGUIRenderer – a renderer for Java applications
 HTMLRenderer – a renderer for Web applications
 Renderable – an interface for any object that can be rendered by a renderer
Draw a UML class diagram to describe the basic design for the Student Transcript System. Your
diagram should include the given classes and interfaces and should show the relationships (with
appropriate multiplicities) among them. Interfaces and classes must show the most important
methods that are required for the functionality mentioned in the problem description. Make sure
that your design satisfies the design principles we discussed in class.",,Hard,"https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gabrielm/211/exams/MidtermPracticeExercises-09wTerm2.pdf

885,SWE,"Each of the following questions (c)-(e) gives a pair of concepts. It can be a pair of techniques, or a pair of tools, or a pair of
processes, etc. Given a pair, please explain why the first one could be better (e.g., more likely to succeed and reduce software
engineering effort, or to improve software engineering outcomes) than the second. Your explanation may depend on the
specific pair given. For full credit, please also briefly describe a situation to illustrate why the first is better than the second.
Note that your answer should not only explain why the first may be good, but also why the second may not be good. For each
question, please use no more than four sentences.",,,'
