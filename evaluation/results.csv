2,Networking,Easy,What is the maximum overhead in byte-stuffing algorithm?,"The maximum overhead occurs when the payload consists of only ESC and
FLAG bytes. In this case, there will be 100% overhead.","What is the maximum overhead in byte-stuffing algorithm? [duplicate]
I was reading about byte-stuffing algorithm and I have a doubt. When we have to send a byte with value 0x00, we can't use it as a delimiter, so we add 0x01 before it. What is the maximum overhead in this case? I mean, what is the maximum number of bits we can add to a byte before sending it?
The overhead is 1 bit. You don't add a 0x01 before the 0x00, you add a 0x01 before the byte containing the 0x00.",1.0,"What is the maximum overhead in byte-stuffing algorithm?
